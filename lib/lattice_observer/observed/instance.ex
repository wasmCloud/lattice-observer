  An instance represents an observation of a unit of scalability within the lattice. Instances
  have unique IDs (GUIDs) and are stored along with the host on which they exist and the ID of
  the specification (`AppSpec` model) responsible for that instance. Actors and Capability Providers
  both have instances while link definitions do not.
